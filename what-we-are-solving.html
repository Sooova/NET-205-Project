                        In 2024, there were approximately 50 million people worldwide who classed themselves either as
                        influencers or social media content creators (Trittin-Ulbrich & Glozer, 2024, p.1812). Content
                        creators were able to monetise their content by encouraging social media users to follow them
                        and through commercial collaborations. Content creators were required to invest a significant
                        amount of time to build up their following base and relied on algorithms to push their content
                        to their viewers. In 2024, there was a lack of transparency on how these algorithms worked which
                        meant that the content creators’ income was beholden to the platforms. Content creators provided
                        free labour to social media networking sites such as Instagram, Facebook and TikTok through user
                        generated content and through the creation of data. Platforms profited and exploited this free
                        labour by selling the data to other organisations for targeted advertising (Helmond, 2015, p.4).
                        While few content creators were able to generate an adequate income for their social media
                        content, many influencers worked either for free or were paid inadequately (Trittin-Ulbrich &
                        Glozer, 2024, p.1812). </p>

                        Social media platforms were able to exploit content creators by profiting from the free labour
                        provided by content creators. Social media sites such as Instagram had approximately four
                        different types of profitable content creators (Yazdanipoor et al., 2022, p.179). This included:

                    Content creators such as Celebrities, Influencers and Shoutouts worked in collaboration with
                    businesses to promote products or services. Ordinary users generated content on social media
                    platforms which generated attention from other users. Social media platforms collected, monitored
                    and sold the ordinary user’s data for advertising, which Advertisers used to target online
                    advertisements (Dolber, 2016, p.747). Ordinary users provided the social networking sites with free
                    labour by creating data, which was monitored and analysed for the platforms to monetize.

                            In the late 1990’s-2020’s, the Network Economy (also known as the Information Economy)
                            thrived. The technology at this time enabled computers to connect through networks allowing
                            “communication between computers” which enabled a way of creating wealth (Kelly, 1997,
                            n.p.). Social Networking Sites such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, X (also known as
                            Twitter) and TikTok became leaders in the field, creating a monopolisation as they purchased
                            and merged other social networking sites with theirs. Users were required to create an
                            account with these sites to be able to access other sites, e.g to sign up for Threads you
                            needed to have an Instagram account. This gave content creators a limited number of options
                            as they were required to either join these sites or to find another social networking site
                            to remain connected. As the majority of content creators used one or more of these
                            platforms, if a creator wanted to switch to another lesser-known social networking site it
                            was likely that they would lose their followers. These platforms needed users and content
                            creators to be successful and to profit. The more content and more user accounts that were
                            connected to their networks, the more profitable these platforms were, this was known as a
                            network effect (Srnicek, 2017, p.257). Content creators would have invested a significant
                            amount of unpaid labour to develop their content and to form relationships/networks with
                            their users, if they wanted to switch to another social network site this would take
                            considerable time and resources to rebuild. Content creators were trapped into remaining
                            with these social networking platforms. </p>

                            The Covid-19 Pandemic in 2020, highlighted the power of technological companies when they
                            were able to switch their business models and infrastructure into other areas. During the
                            pandemic, organisations and businesses which were not classed as essential services were
                            closed, and the majority of employees were required to work from home. This was a major
                            disrupter to the 2020 labour workforce, as organisations relied on digital technologies to
                            provide services for employees to pivot to remote working models. Companies, organisations
                            and the people depended on digital technologies to continue to work and socialise, through a
                            time of physical isolation caused by Covid. </p>

                            Technological companies were able to rapidly increase their services, as well as to expand
                            into other areas such as healthcare models and education. For example, in the UK a private
                            security company were able to transition monitoring and organising the booking and handling
                            of Covid testing program, and Google and Apple partnered to develop a contract tracing

                            (Solano et al., 2020, p.45). Covid brought a sense of urgency and uncertainty into the
                            community which meant there was a decrease in the level of scrutiny, “with relaxed oversight
                            and minimal contestation” for these organisations (Solano et al., 2020, p.45). During this
                            time, five key trends were identified: </p>

                            The Covid-19 Pandemic highlighted the role and the reliance of digital technologies in our
                            lives and the economy. During Covid-19, the relationship between technology and the digital
                            economy may be considered as a time of neoliberalism, as private businesses provided
                            services which typically would have been provided by government services, and economic
                            growth was enabled through the decrease in oversight and regulations (Kammas, 2022, n.p.).

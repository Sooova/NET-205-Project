                        In 2024, there were approximately 50 million people worldwide who classed themselves either as

                        creators were able to monetise their content by encouraging social media users to follow them
                        and through commercial collaborations. Content creators were required to invest a significant
                        amount of time to build up their following base and relied on algorithms to push their content
                        to their viewers. In 2024, there was a lack of transparency on how these algorithms worked which
                        meant that the content creators’ income was beholden to the platforms. Content creators provided
                        free labour to social media networking sites such as Instagram, Facebook and TikTok through user
                        generated content and through the creation of data. Platforms profited and exploited this free

                        While few content creators were able to generate an adequate income for their social media

                            In the late 1990’s-2020’s, the Network Economy (also known as the Information Economy)
                            thrived. The technology at this time enabled computers to connect through networks allowing
                            “communication between computers” which enabled a way of creating wealth <a class="text-algora-600 underline cursor-pointer" onclick="showCitation('Kelly')">(Kelly, 1997,
                            n.p.)</a>. Social Networking Sites such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, X (also known as
                            Twitter) and TikTok became leaders in the field, creating a monopolisation as they purchased
                            and merged other social networking sites with theirs. Users were required to create an
                            account with these sites to be able to access other sites, e.g to sign up for Threads you
                            needed to have an Instagram account. This gave content creators a limited number of options
                            as they were required to either join these sites or to find another social networking site
                            to remain connected. As the majority of content creators used one or more of these
                            platforms, if a creator wanted to switch to another lesser-known social networking site it
                            was likely that they would lose their followers. These platforms needed users and content
                            creators to be successful and to profit. The more content and more user accounts that were
                            connected to their networks, the more profitable these platforms were, this was known as a
                            network effect <a class="text-algora-600 underline cursor-pointer" onclick="showCitation('Srnicek')">(Srnicek, 2017, p.257)</a>. Content creators would have invested a significant

                            their users, if they wanted to switch to another social network site this would take
                            considerable time and resources to rebuild. Content creators were trapped into remaining
                            with these social networking platforms. </p>

                            The Covid-19 Pandemic in 2020, highlighted the power of technological companies when they
                            were able to switch their business models and infrastructure into other areas. During the
                            pandemic, organisations and businesses which were not classed as essential services were
                            closed, and the majority of employees were required to work from home. This was a major
                            disrupter to the 2020 labour workforce, as organisations relied on digital technologies to
                            provide services for employees to pivot to remote working models. Companies, organisations
                            and the people depended on digital technologies to continue to work and socialise, through a
                            time of physical isolation caused by Covid. </p>
